# ðŸ‘‹ Ciao, I'm Andrea

I am a Software and Compiler Engineer with a strong passion for creating high-performance, scalable software solutions. Currently pursuing my MSc in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, I specialize in performance optimization, architecture-specific code generation, and advanced systems design.

## ðŸ”§ Key Skills & Interests

- **Programming Languages & Tools**: C++, Python, Swift
- **Tools**: MLIR, ONNX-MLIR, CMAKE
- **Specializations**: Compiler design, neural network acceleration, cybersecurity
- **Interests**: Low-level programming, performance tuning, and exploring innovative hardware/software co-design.

## ðŸ“š Notable Projects

- (currently private code) **Novel MLIR Compiler for Accelerating Neural Networks with Process-In-Memory Architectures**  
   Achieved substantial energy efficiency gains for GoogLeNet and VGG-16 models (37x and 1.3x respectively) by optimizing data movement with custom MLIR transformations and optimizations.
- **[Porting LittleFS to Miosix OS](https://github.com/thegoldgoat/miosix-kernel)**  
   Integrated a fail-safe file system into an embedded operating system, enabling a graceful recovery after power failure.
- **[Toccami](https://thegoldgoat.github.io/toccami_linux/)**  
   Created a remote virtual touchpad with multitouch gestures via a Linux kernel module and a cross-platform mobile app.

## ðŸ“„ Publications & Research

- **Upcoming CGO 2025 Paper**: "Combining MLIR Dialects with Domain-Specific Architecture for Efficient Regular Expression Matching"  
   Built a novel compiler framework for efficient regular expression matching targeting FPGAs, achieving significant speedup and energy efficiency improvements. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/necst/cicero).
